      After years of applying my knowledge in Psychology to create product strategies and messaging in Advertising, I chose to hone my business acumen
      working with tech startups expand into international markets. Throughout this journey, I identified the importance of having users
      at the focal point of product design and development to achieve business objectives. To improve on my knowledge, I have gained knowledge in the
      areas of User Experience (UX) Design, User Interface (UI) Design and Front-end Development.

      At the confluence of technology, business and psychology lies the core of my superpowers - designing user-centered solutions that align with
      business requirements, and meet human needs! Nothing gives me more joy than helping people focus on what really matters.

      I live for experiences in whichever form they come – knowledge, places, music, food, people, culture – you name it, I take it all in.
      Did I mention that I can live without M&Ms? That’s right, Music and Movies! They complete me.
