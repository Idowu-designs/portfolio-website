  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    After years of applying my knowledge in Psychology to create product strategies and messaging in Advertising, I chose to hone my business acumen
    working with tech startups expand into international markets. Throughout this journey, I have identified that the constant, the users, must
    remain the focal point for the desired product and financial outcome. This is why I have developed skills in UX Design.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the confluence of technology, business and psychology lies the core of my superpowers - designing user-centered solutions that align with
    business requirements, and meet human needs! Nothing gives me more joy than helping people focus on what really matters.
  </p>
  <p>
    I live for experiences in whichever form they come – knowledge, places, music, food, people, culture – you name it, I take it all in.
    Did I mention that I can live without M&Ms? That’s right, Music and Movies! They complete me.
